# Token Distribution

WorldLand's allocation is designed so that the majority of supply is delivered through ongoing network operation (mining and compute resource participation).

## Distribution Philosophy

::: tip Majority to Network Participants
Over **50%** of the total supply goes to Compute Resources, ensuring that the network is primarily owned by those who actively participate and contribute.
:::

### Compute Resources (50.46%)

The largest allocation is distributed through:

- **PoW Mining** - Block rewards for securing the network
- **Compute Participation** - Rewards for providing GPU resources
- **Emission Rate** - Approximately 5.184M WL minted every 30 days

### Core Builders (15%)

Reserved for the development team with:

- 12-month cliff period
- 10% vesting every 3 months after cliff

### Ecosystem (20%)

The Ecosystem Pool is allocated for long-term network growth and sustainability:

#### 1. Research and Development

A portion of the ecosystem allocation is reserved for ongoing research and development, including core protocol design, Proof-of-Compute verification improvements, and Web3 Cloud infrastructure development.

#### 2. Mainnet Alpha Mining Swap Program

A portion of the ecosystem allocation is designated for participants who contributed GPU resources and mined WorldLand during the mainnet alpha phase. These participants will be eligible to swap their WLC tokens into WL at the launch of the mainnet beta on March 31, 2026. This program is designed to reward real compute contribution and early network participation.

#### 3. Ecosystem Application Growth

A portion of the ecosystem allocation is reserved to support ecosystem applications building on WorldLand, including use cases related to compute, storage, training, and inference.

#### 4. Initial Development Contributions

A portion of the ecosystem allocation is reserved for early development contributors such as Libervance and GIST. These contributors support the ecosystem by developing, uploading, and maintaining core protocol code, verification modules, research outputs, and infrastructure components that contribute to scaling and long-term adoption.

#### 5. Governance and Future Allocation

Final allocation amounts, distribution timing, and usage conditions will be determined through governance mechanisms as the protocol matures. The DAO will have authority to adjust ecosystem allocation parameters to align with long-term network growth and contributor incentives.

### Community & Liquidity (14.54%)

Fully unlocked at TGE (Token Generation Event) to support:

- Initial exchange liquidity
- Market accessibility on community platforms
- Enhanced visibility and trading facilitation
