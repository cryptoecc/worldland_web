## Abstract

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming every sector of the global economy, yet the computational resources required to train and run these models are becoming increasingly centralized. WorldLand addresses this by creating a decentralized network where anyone can contribute GPU resources and anyone can access them, with cryptographic guarantees that the work was performed correctly.
