# Whitepaper

## Introduction

WorldLand is building the first decentralized computing infrastructure that cryptographically verifies AI execution. By combining a purpose-built blockchain with **Proof-of-Compute**, we enable a trustless market for GPU resources.

## Content Overview

The technical whitepaper covers the following core areas:

- **Vision**: Democratizing Access to AI Compute
- **Architecture**: WorldLand Mainnet, Verification Layer, and GPU Nodes
- **Proof-of-Compute**: The consensus mechanism for verifying off-chain compute
- **Tokenomics**: Economic model design and simulation
- **Governance**: Decentralized decision-making processes
