# Users & Community

## Welcome to the WorldLand Community

At **WorldLand**, our community is built around delivering verifiable Web3 cloud infrastructure.

WorldLand provides **decentralized GPU-based cloud services**, including compute, storage, training, inference, and agent execution. What makes WorldLand different is that these cloud services are paired with **Proof-of-Compute** — a verification layer that confirms whether GPUs actually performed the AI tasks they were assigned.

Whether you are a node operator contributing GPU resources, a developer running AI workloads, or a builder integrating verification into your own AI platform, you are part of the WorldLand ecosystem.

> Our community brings together infrastructure providers, AI developers, researchers, and Web3 builders who want both cloud performance and verifiable execution in a single unified stack.

## Ways to Get Involved

There are multiple ways to participate in the WorldLand ecosystem:

### 💬 Join Discussions

Connect with the WorldLand team and community through our official **[X (Twitter)](https://twitter.com/Worldland_space)** and **[Telegram](https://discord.gg/yJERYVnE6a)** channels to discuss protocol architecture, Web3 cloud services, Proof-of-Compute, and roadmap milestones.

### 🖥️ Run Nodes and Provide Web3 Cloud Services

Participate as a **node operator** by contributing GPU resources that power WorldLand’s decentralized Web3 cloud. Nodes provide GPU compute, storage, training, and inference services while participating in Proof-of-Compute to verify that workloads were executed as claimed.

### 🛠️ Build AI Applications on WorldLand

Developers can use WorldLand’s Web3 cloud to run AI training, inference, and agent workloads with **on-chain verification** of GPU compute usage.

### 🔗 Integrate the Proof-of-Compute Verification Layer

AI projects, DePIN networks, and decentralized compute platforms can integrate WorldLand’s **Proof-of-Compute layer** to verify GPU workloads executed on their own infrastructure, enabling interoperability while maintaining trust-minimized verification.

### 📅 Participate in Events and Research

Join technical AMAs, protocol briefings, and ecosystem sessions focused on decentralized cloud infrastructure and verifiable AI compute.

## WorldLand Cloud, Node & Verification Programs

WorldLand supports community participation across cloud services and verification.

### Web3 Cloud Participation

WorldLand provides decentralized cloud services powered by GPUs, including:

- Compute
- Storage
- AI Training
- Inference
- Agent Execution

These services are designed to be directly usable by developers and enterprises.

### Node Participation (Proof-of-Compute)

Node operators supply GPU resources and execute AI workloads. **Proof-of-Compute** verifies that assigned tasks were actually performed, ensuring transparency and integrity across the cloud infrastructure.

### Cross-Protocol AI Verification

WorldLand acts as a **shared verification layer** for AI projects. Other AI networks and applications can use their own GPU providers while relying on WorldLand to verify execution outcomes and compute usage, creating a common verification standard across AI ecosystems.
