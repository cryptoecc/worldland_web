# WorldLand Token ($WL)

**WL** is the native utility coin of the WorldLand ecosystem, designed to power the decentralized AI compute economy.

## Overview

The WL coin serves as the fundamental unit of value within the WorldLand network. It aligns the incentives of GPU providers, AI developers, and the protocol itself, creating a sustainable loop of compute supply and demand.

## Utility & Use Cases

WL is used for:

1.  **Payment for Compute**

    - AI companies and developers use $WL to pay for GPU resources (training, inference, etc.).
    - This creates a direct demand for the token correlated with network usage.

2.  **Provider Incentives (Mining)**

    - Node operators (Providers) earn $WL rewards for contributing GPU power and passing Proof-of-Compute verification.
    - This incentivizes the expansion of the decentralized infrastructure.

3.  **Staking & Security**

    - Validators and high-tier GPU nodes must stake $WL to participate in the network.
    - Staking ensures honest behavior; malicious actors risk slashing penalties.

4.  **Governance (DAO)**
    - $WL holders can propose and vote on key protocol upgrades, parameter changes, and treasury allocations through the WorldLand DAO.
