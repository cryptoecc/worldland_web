# Key Features

WorldLand combines blockchain technology with distributed GPU infrastructure to create a generic GPU compute marketplace.

## Instant GPU Access

WorldLand Cloud provides on-demand GPU containers designed for AI researchers and developers:

- **Full SSH access** as root user
- **Pre-installed CUDA** and NVIDIA drivers
- **Flexible resources** — Choose GPU model, CPU, memory, and storage
- **Public connectivity** — Access your container from anywhere
- **Pay-as-you-go** — Hourly billing with no long-term commitments

Users can start training AI models or running inference nodes **within minutes** at a fraction of the cost of centralized clouds.

## Dual-Mode GPU Operation

GPU providers in WorldLand maximize utilization and earnings by operating in two distinct modes:

### Service Mode (On-Demand)

- **Primary Function**: Renting out GPU computing power to customers.
- **Role**: AI Training, Inference, Rendering, etc.
- **Earnings**: High-yield service fees paid by users.

### Mining Mode (Idle)

- **Fallback Function**: Participating in network consensus when no rental jobs are assigned.
- **Role**: Securing the blockchain network.
- **Earnings**: Block rewards in WL.

This dual-mode design ensures **zero-idle efficiency**—GPU resources are always generating value.

## Web3-Native & Permissionless

As a DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network), WorldLand removes barriers to entry:

- **Wallet-based Login** — No complex sign-up, just sign with your wallet.
- **Global Access** — Register a GPU or rent one from anywhere in the world.
- **Transparent Pricing** — A decentralized market where supply and demand determine rates.
- **Diverse Support** — From individual gaming rigs to enterprise data centers, all can participate.

## Technical Roadmap: Verifiable Compute

> **Under Research & Development**
>
> The following features are part of WorldLand's long-term technical vision to bring trustless verification to off-chain computation.

### Proof-of-Compute (Verification Layer)

WorldLand is developing a cryptographic verification layer to ensure that off-chain GPU work is executed honestly without requiring trust in the provider.
The proposed commit-challenge-response protocol aims to:

- Randomly audit execution results.
- Penalize dishonest providers via slashing.
- Create a "Trustless" compute market.

### ECCVCC Consensus

To support this verification, WorldLand proposes **ECCVCC (Error Correction Code Verifiable Computation Consensus)**, a novel Proof-of-Work mechanism designed to integrate useful compute work into blockchain consensus.

_Note: These verification technologies are currently under active research and will be rolled out in future phases._
