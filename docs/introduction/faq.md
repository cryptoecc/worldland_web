# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### What is WorldLand?

**WorldLand** is a decentralized GPU cloud infrastructure (DePIN) designed for the AI era. It connects GPU providers with AI developers who need computing power. Unlike traditional clouds, WorldLand includes a unique **Proof-of-Compute** layer that verifies whether the AI tasks were actually executed correctly by the GPUs, ensuring trust and transparency.

### What is Proof-of-Compute?

**Proof-of-Compute** is WorldLand's verification mechanism. It acts as a "consensus on execution." When a node performs an AI task (training or inference), it generates cryptographic proof that verifies the computation was done as requested. This prevents fraud and ensures high-quality service without relying on centralized trust.

## Participation

### How can I provide GPU resources?

If you have enterprise-grade GPUs, you can join the network as a **Provider**. You will need to install the WorldLand Provider SDK and run a node. By contributing your GPU power, you earn **WL** coins as a reward. Check the [Provider Guide](/cloud/provider/how-to-provide) for setup instructions.

### How can I use the Cloud for AI?

Developers can rent GPUs through the **[WorldLand Cloud Console](https://cloud.worldland.foundation)**. You can launch instances for training, fine-tuning, or inference at a much lower cost than verified centralized providers. All usage is verified on-chain.

## Tokenomics

### What is WL ($WLC)?

**WL** is the native utility coin of the WorldLand network. It is used for:

- **Payment**: Paying for GPU resources (compute power).
- **Reward**: Incentivizing node operators (miners) for providing reliable compute.
- **Governance**: Participating in DAO voting to shape the future of the protocol.
- **Staking**: Securing the network (for Validators/Brokers).

### Where can I check the token distribution?

Please refer to the [Token Distribution](/tokenomics/distribution) and [Vesting Schedule](/tokenomics/vesting) pages for detailed economic models.
