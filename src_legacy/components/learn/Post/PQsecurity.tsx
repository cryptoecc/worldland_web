        WorldLand incorporates code theory to enhance resistance against quantum computer attacks. Quantum computers
        have the potential to break traditional cryptographic algorithms, which could compromise the security of
        blockchain networks. By leveraging code theory, WorldLand strengthens the cryptographic mechanisms used within
        its system, making it more resilient against potential quantum threats. This helps safeguard the
        decentralization of the network and ensures the long-term security of WorldLand in the presence of advanced
        quantum computing technology.
